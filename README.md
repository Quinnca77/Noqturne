This Windows application aims to provide an automated way of downloading and tagging your songs from YouTube. By just supplying it with a playlist URL, it can download all of its songs
and give them the appropriate cover art quickly without needing any user interaction.

### Dependencies
To retrieve the cover art, a python library called `ytmusicapi` is used. Its repository can be found [here](https://github.com/sigma67/ytmusicapi). 

Also, `yt-dlp` is used to download songs from YouTube. Their repository can be found [here](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp). 

That's not all. When converting the video downloaded from YouTube to `mp3` format, it uses `ffmpeg` to perform this conversion. Their site can be found [here](https://www.ffmpeg.org/).

## Installation
You have a few options to choose from when installing this application:
- Downloading the latest stable release by downloading the .jar file in the latest release
- Cloning the repository and running src/main/java/org/noqturne/Main in IntelliJ (Community edition can be found [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)).
I do not recommend trying to build this project in a different IDE or configuration, since it uses IntelliJ's UI designer files to generate the Java code for most of the GUI.

As long as you have both Python and Java installed on your machine, the application will ensure other dependencies are present
when it needs them.
### Installing Python
Go to [Python's download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version. If you prefer an older version, any version >=3.9 should be fine.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Be sure to check the box that says to add Python to the PATH variable!!!**

Follow the rest of the installation instructions. You can verify that Python was successfully installed by opening a command prompt (Windows + Start, type `cmd`) and typing in
```
python --version
```
If this does not return an error, you're good.


### Installing Java
Go to the [Java Download page](https://www.java.com/en/download/) and follow the installation instructions. In case you struggle with this you can follow this guide 
[here](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-java-windows). To verify your installation, you can run the following line in a command prompt:
```
java --version
```
Once again, if it doesn't return an error you're good.

Now you're done installing and ready to use this application!

## Usage
This application has three main use cases:
- Tag all `mp3` files in a specified folder (by default your Downloads folder)
- Download a song or playlist of songs and tag them immediately after
- Tag an individual song with the thumbnail of a specified YouTube video

All of these are very straight-forward, but be aware that the cover art finding is done on the **mp3 file title!** If your mp3 file title is complete nonsense, expect for the found cover art
to match that nonsense. 

> [!TIP]
> Use the `Rename file?` option to rename all files before they are tagged. Giving your songs sensible names in this window will make sure the cover art finder works optimally.

In case the cover art finder finds an entirely different cover art than intended, try finding the song on [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com/) yourself with the given artist name and
title. If you do not see the cover art that the cover art finder found, but instead the correct cover art, you can [contact](#contact) me with the details of your query and I'll see if I can
improve the algorithm somehow.

## Contributions
I am currently not accepting external contributions to this repository. If you really want to make changes yourself, please make a fork or open a GitHub issue if it's about a bug. 
No guarantees are given on the time taken for a bug to be patched, this is a hobby project after all.

## FAQ
#### Is this still being maintained?
Yes, although the last commit might have been a while ago. As long as there are still bugs to be fixed and improvements to be made (AKA always), I will be maintaining this project until stated otherwise.
#### I cannot get this project to work for me
Technically, that's not even a question, but I'll let that slip for now. Try to follow the steps in [Installation](#installation) as closely as possible and if you still cannot figure out why things 
don't work, you can always contact me.
#### Is there not a better way to find cover art than just checking the filename?
I have thought about this for a long time actually, and found that there is no more reliable way to do it (that I seem to be capable of anyway). In very early iterations of this application,
I used the [MusicBrainz API](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_API) to find a song and tag it with the appropriate cover art. This worked even with nonsense filenames, since it used the
contents of the song, the actual music, to find the song in their database. The only reason I did not use this method is that I found their database to be extremely lacking in its
coverage of songs. It seemed like the moment a song was even remotely unpopular, niche or unofficial in any way, MusicBrainz would not have an entry for it in their database. 
So I went with YouTube instead, which seems to have a way bigger database of songs than MusicBrainz.
#### I want to tag a song that is not an mp3 file. Can I do this?
Unfortunately, this application is made with only mp3 files in mind. Adding support for other extensions as well would be a big endeavour, and although I wouldn't exclude the possibility of this
being added in the future, I wouldn't count on it.
#### When downloading and tagging, something goes wrong with the download. What could this be?
Since YouTube is an ever-changing platform, the downloader for it has to change with it. Yt-dlp often gets updated and previous versions might not work as well anymore. If something
goes wrong while downloading, try to update the dependencies through the settings menu and do it again.
#### Will there ever be a Linux or Mac release?
No.
